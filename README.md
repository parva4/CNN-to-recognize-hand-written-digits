# CNN-to-recognize-hand-written-digits
To run the code, please follow the steps below [Dataset Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pen-based+recognition+of+handwritten+digits]:
• Upload files named ‘pendigits-orig.tra’, ‘pendigits-orig.tes’, ‘pendigits-train.csv’ and
‘pendigits-test.csv’ on your google colab
• Create folders called ‘digit_train’ and ‘digit_test’ each containing 10 sub-folders
named 0,1,2,...,9
• Then run the code chunk from my .ipynb that has the comments ‘#outputs’ and
‘#images from coordinates’
• And then fun the ‘train_Data’ and ‘test_Data’ chunks
• This chunk extracts coordinates from the text file and converts text into an image
representing a digit
